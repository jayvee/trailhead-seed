description: Suggest the most likely next workflow action based on current context
---
# aigon-next

Inspect the current git branch, worktree status, and Kanban stage to automatically suggest the most likely next workflow action. Eliminates the need to remember command names for the happy path.

## Step 1: Gather context

Run all three commands:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

```bash
git status --short
```

```bash
aigon board --list --active
```

## Step 2: Parse the branch name

Extract context from the branch name using the pattern `feature-<ID>-<agent>-<description>` or `research-<ID>-<agent>-<description>`:

- **Type**: `feature` or `research`
- **ID**: numeric ID (e.g., `25`)
- **Agent**: agent code (e.g., `cc`, `gg`, `cx`, `cu`) — if absent, this is a Drive branch
- **Description**: slug description

**Drive vs worktree**: if the agent segment is one of `cc`, `gg`, `cx`, `cu`, this is a Fleet worktree branch — `feature-do` runs automatically on open and must NOT be suggested. If the agent segment is absent (branch is `feature-<ID>-<description>`), this is a Drive branch — `feature-do` must be run manually.

If the branch is `main` (or `master`), skip to **Path D: Main branch**.

## Step 3: Apply the decision tree

### Path A: Feature branch with uncommitted changes

**Condition**: Branch matches `feature-<ID>-*` AND `git status --short` is non-empty

**Suggestion**:
> You have uncommitted changes on feature branch `<branch>`.
>
> **Suggested next step:**
> Commit your changes, update your feature log, then run:
> `aigon agent-status submitted`
>
> Implementation is only complete after `aigon agent-status submitted` succeeds.

---

### Path B: Feature branch with no uncommitted changes

**Condition**: Branch matches `feature-<ID>-*` AND `git status --short` is empty

**Check**: Run `git log main..HEAD --oneline` to count commits on this branch beyond the base. Also check whether this is a Drive branch (no agent code) or a worktree branch (agent code present).

#### B1: Drive branch, no implementation commits yet (only the spec-move commit or zero commits)

> You are on Drive branch `<branch>` with no uncommitted changes and no implementation yet.
>
> **Suggested next step:**
> `/aigon:feature-do <ID>`
>
> This opens the feature spec and starts the implementation session.

#### B2: Drive branch with implementation commits

> You are on Drive branch `<branch>` with commits and no uncommitted changes.
>
> **Suggested next steps:**
>
> 1. `aigon agent-status submitted` — mark implementation complete and signal ready for review
> 2. `/aigon:feature-do <ID>` — continue implementing if not yet done

#### B3: Worktree branch (agent code present), any state

> You are in a Fleet worktree (`<branch>`). `feature-do` runs automatically on worktree open — do not suggest it.
>
> **Suggested next step:**
> `aigon agent-status submitted` — once your implementation and log updates are complete

---

### Path C: Research branch

**Condition**: Branch matches `research-<ID>-*`

**Check**: Does `aigon board --list --active` show findings already written for this research ID?

**If no findings yet**:
> You are on research branch `<branch>`.
>
> **Suggested next step:**
> `/aigon:research-do <ID>`
>
> This will guide you through writing your research findings.

**If findings exist**:
> You are on research branch `<branch>` with findings already written.
>
> **Suggested next steps:**
>
> 1. `/aigon:research-close <ID>` — if research is complete
> 2. `/aigon:research-do <ID>` — to continue or update findings

---

### Path D: Main branch

**Condition**: Branch is `main` or `master`

Check `aigon board --list --active` output for in-progress items.

#### D1: In-progress features found

Count the worktrees for each in-progress feature (from board output — look for `Fleet (cc, gg...)` vs `Drive`).

**Fleet mode** (2+ agents): Suggest eval
> Feature `#<ID> <name>` is in progress (Fleet mode).
>
> **Suggested next step:**
> `/aigon:feature-eval <ID>`
>
> This will compare all agent implementations and select the best one.

**Drive mode** (1 agent, no agent code in branch name): Check whether implementation has been done.

Look at the board output for agent status. If the agent shows `submitted` or `done`, suggest close. Otherwise suggest do. Note: Drive mode requires the user to manually run `feature-do`; it is NOT run automatically.

**If not yet submitted**:
> Feature `#<ID> <name>` is in progress (Drive mode).
>
> **Suggested next step:**
> `/aigon:feature-do <ID>`
>
> This starts the implementation session on the Drive branch.

**If submitted/done**:
> Feature `#<ID> <name>` is implemented and submitted.
>
> **Suggested next step:**
> `/aigon:feature-close <ID>`
>
> This will merge your implementation.

#### D2: In-progress research found

> Research `#<ID> <name>` is in progress.
>
> **Suggested next step:**
> `/aigon:research-close <ID>`
>
> Or to continue conducting: `/aigon:research-do <ID>`

#### D3: Nothing active — backlog or inbox items available

Show the board summary and suggest starting something new:

> Nothing is currently in progress.
>
> **Suggested next steps:**
>
> 1. `/aigon:feature-now <name>` — fast-track a new or inbox feature
> 2. `/aigon:board` — view the full Kanban board to pick what to work on next

---

### Path E: Ambiguous or unrecognised context

**Condition**: Branch name doesn't match any known pattern, or context is unclear

Fall back to showing the board and suggesting the user pick:
> Context is ambiguous (branch: `<branch>`).
>
> **Showing board instead:**

Run `aigon board` and display the output. Then suggest:
> Run `/aigon:board` for details, or `/aigon:feature-now <name>` to start something new.

---

## Step 4: Present the suggestion

- Display the suggestion(s) clearly as a ready-to-copy Aigon agent command
- If there are multiple plausible actions, show a short numbered list (max 3 options)
- Always include a one-line explanation of what the command does
- Do NOT auto-execute the suggested command — always let the user confirm
