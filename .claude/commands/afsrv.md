# aigon-feature-spec-revise

You are the author-side agent. Review all pending `spec-review:` commits on the feature spec, decide what to keep, and land one acknowledgement commit.

## Resolve the spec

```bash
SPEC_PATH=$(aigon feature-spec {{args}} 2>/dev/null || true)
if [ -z "$SPEC_PATH" ]; then
  SPEC_PATH=$(find docs/specs/features -maxdepth 2 \( -name "feature-{{args}}-*.md" -o -name "feature-{{args}}.md" \) | head -1)
fi
test -n "$SPEC_PATH" && echo "$SPEC_PATH"
```

If `SPEC_PATH` is empty, stop and report that the feature spec could not be resolved.

## Find pending review commits

Find the latest acknowledgement, if any:

```bash
LAST_ACK=$(git log --follow --format=%H -n 1 --grep='^spec-review-check:' --grep='^spec-revise:' -- "$SPEC_PATH")
echo "last_ack=${LAST_ACK:-none}"
```

Then inspect pending reviews newer than that acknowledgement:

```bash
git log --follow --format='%H %s' -- "$SPEC_PATH"
```

Pending reviews are commits whose subject starts with `spec-review:` and are newer than `LAST_ACK` if `LAST_ACK` exists.

For every pending review commit:

```bash
git show <sha> -- "$SPEC_PATH"
git show -s --format=%B <sha>
```

## Decide in one pass

Process all pending reviewers together. Your options are:

- Accept: keep the reviewed spec as-is.
- Revert: revert one or more review commits.
- Modify: keep the reviewer intent but make follow-up edits before acknowledging.

If you need changes, make them before the acknowledgement commit.

## Acknowledge with one commit

After the spec is in its final state, commit exactly once with:

```bash
git add "$SPEC_PATH"
git commit --allow-empty -m "spec-revise: feature {{args}} — <decision summary>" -m "reviewed: <comma-separated reviewer ids>

Decision:
- <accept|revert|modify summary>

Notes:
- <important rationale>"
aigon feature-spec-revise-record {{args}}
```

If you reverted review commits, include that rationale in the acknowledgement commit body rather than creating a second ack commit.

## Report

Tell the user:

1. Which pending reviews you processed.
2. Whether you accepted, reverted, or modified the reviewed changes.
3. Any follow-up edits you made to the spec.
