# Development Workflow

This project uses **Aigon**, a spec-driven development workflow for AI agents.

For codebase structure and CLI module boundaries, read `docs/architecture.md`.

## Overview

Aigon enforces a structured **Research → Specification → Implementation** loop:

1. **Research Topics** explore the "why" before building
2. **Feature Specs** define the "what" to build

For feature implementation, Aigon can be used in "Solo mode" or "Arena mode".
1. "Solo mode" - use one agent to implement the feature based on the spec to completion.
2. "Arena mode" - use multiple agents to implement a feature in parallel, then evaluate solutions and select a winner.

## Directory Structure

All workflow state lives in `./docs/specs/`. Folders are numbered for visual ordering:

```

│   ├── 02-backlog/      # Prioritised research

### Feature Commands (Unified for Solo and Arena modes)
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `aigon feature-create <name>` | Create a new feature spec |
| `aigon feature-prioritise <name>` | Assign ID and move to backlog |
| `aigon feature-start <ID> [agents...]` | Setup for solo (no agents) or arena (with agents) |
| `aigon feature-do <ID> [--iterate]` | Implement feature; `--iterate` runs iterate loop |
| `aigon feature-eval <ID>` | Create evaluation (code review for solo, comparison for arena) |
| `aigon feature-close <ID> [agent]` | Merge and complete (specify agent in arena mode) |
| `aigon feature-cleanup <ID>` | Clean up arena worktrees and branches |

## Key Rules

1. **Spec-Driven**: Never write code without resolving the active feature spec via `aigon feature-spec <ID>`
2. **Work in isolation**: Solo mode uses branches, arena mode uses worktrees
3. **Implementation Logs**: Document implementation decisions in `logs/` before completing
4. **Feature lifecycle is engine-backed**: workflow-core is the authority for features, and visible spec folders are a projection of that state

## Pre-authorised Spec Notes

Feature specs may include an optional `## Pre-authorised` section after `## Validation`.

- Use it for bounded standing approvals specific to that feature, such as a small test-budget increase or a known-safe validation skip.
- Before stopping on a policy gate, agents must check that section.
- If a line authorises the action, proceed and cite it in the commit footer as `Pre-authorised-by: ...`.
- If the section is blank or absent, behavior is unchanged: stop and ask.

## Feature State Model

For features, there are two relevant layers:

- The authoritative lifecycle state lives in `.aigon/workflows/features/{id}/` and is managed by `lib/workflow-core/`.
- The visible stage is still the spec folder under `docs/specs/features/`, but that folder is a projection of workflow state, not the authority.
- Active feature discovery should use `{{CMD_PREFIX}}feature-list --active` or workflow snapshot reads, not folder probes.

## Solo Mode Workflow

1. Run `aigon feature-start <ID>` to create branch and move spec to in-progress
2. Run `aigon feature-do <ID>` to begin implementation (add `--iterate` for Autopilot retry loop)
3. Read the spec path returned by `aigon feature-spec <ID>`
4. Implement the feature according to the spec
5. Test your changes and wait for user confirmation
6. Commit using conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
7. Update the implementation log in `./docs/specs/features/logs/`
8. **STOP** - Wait for user to approve before running `aigon feature-close <ID>`

## Before Completing a Feature

Before running `feature-close`, always:

1. **Push the branch to origin** to save your work remotely:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <current-branch-name>
   ```
2. **Ask the user** if they want to delete the local branch after merge (the CLI will delete it by default)
