# aigon-feature-create

Run this command followed by the feature name.

```bash
aigon feature-create {{args}}
```

This creates a new feature spec in `./docs/specs/features/01-inbox/`.

**IMPORTANT:** After the CLI command completes, open the created feature file in markdown preview mode in a separate window:
- File: `./docs/specs/features/01-inbox/feature-{{args}}.md` (or similar, check the CLI output for exact filename)
- Open the file, then use Cursor's command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run: `Markdown: Open Preview` (or press `Cmd+Shift+V` / `Ctrl+Shift+V`)
- This will open the markdown preview in a separate window for easy reference while you work

## Before writing the spec

Explore the codebase to understand the existing architecture, patterns, and code relevant to this feature. Plan your approach before writing. Consider:

- What existing code will this feature interact with?
- Are there patterns or conventions in the codebase to follow?
- What technical constraints or dependencies exist?

Use this understanding to write a well-informed spec — especially the **Technical Approach**, **Dependencies**, and **Acceptance Criteria** sections.

### Set the spec frontmatter (`complexity` only)

The template ships with a `complexity:` field in YAML frontmatter. You **must** set it — it drives the per-agent {model, effort} **defaults** in the dashboard start modal (resolved from each agent’s `cli.complexityDefaults[<complexity>]` in `templates/agents/<id>.json`, then `aigon config`). **Do not put model names or effort levels in the spec**; those SKUs change over time and belong only in agent templates + config.

Use this rubric:

- **low** — config tweaks, doc-only changes, single-file helpers, trivial bug fixes.
- **medium** — standard feature with moderate cross-cutting; one command handler, small refactor, a new API route with clear shape.
- **high** — multi-file engine edits, new event types, new dashboard surfaces, judgment-heavy deletion work, anything that requires careful reasoning about invariants.
- **very-high** — architectural shifts, write-path-contract changes, new workflow transitions, cross-cutting template+engine+frontend. Reserve for work where a smaller model is likely to miss load-bearing detail.

## After writing the spec

Commit the spec file:
```bash
git add docs/specs/features/01-inbox/
git commit -m "feat: create feature spec - <name>"
```

Next step: Once the spec is committed, suggest `/aigon:feature-prioritise {{args}}` to assign an ID and move to backlog.

## Prompt Suggestion

End your response with the suggested next command on its own line. This helps agent UIs surface the next suggested Aigon command. Use the actual feature name:

`/aigon:feature-prioritise <name>`
