# Claude Code Configuration

## Agent Identity
- **Agent ID**: `cc`
- **Worktree Pattern**: `../feature-NN-cc-description`
- **Implementation Log**: Mode-conditional — Fleet requires a short log under `./docs/specs/features/logs/`; solo Drive (branch) skips it by default; solo Drive worktree uses a one-line log when a starter file exists. Override with `"logging_level": "fleet-only" | "always" | "never"` in `.aigon/config.json` (see `docs/development_workflow.md`).

## Modes

- **Drive mode**: `/aigon:feature-start <ID>` - Creates branch only, work in current directory
- **Fleet mode**: `/aigon:feature-start <ID> <agents...>` - Creates worktrees for parallel implementation

## Mandatory Lifecycle Commands

Feature and research work are NOT complete until you run these commands yourself:

1. `aigon agent-status implementing` — when you start coding or begin active research
2. `aigon agent-status submitted` — after committing all code, log updates, or research findings

These are direct lifecycle commands you run yourself in the agent host — slash commands for some agents, skills for Codex, and never auto-invoked. The `aigon agent-status` command writes state to the **main repo** (not the worktree), so you won't see state files locally. Just run the command and trust the output.

## Critical Rules

1. **Read the active spec first**: Use `aigon feature-spec <ID>` for features. For research, read the spec directly from `docs/specs/research-topics/03-in-progress/`
2. **Use the correct workspace model**: Feature Drive uses a branch, Feature Fleet uses worktrees, Research usually runs in the main repo unless explicitly launched as parallel sessions
3. **Use conventional commits when you commit**: Prefer `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, or `docs:` as appropriate
4. **Complete with the matching command**: Use the `feature-*` or `research-*` close/review/eval command for the entity you are working on
5. **Follow project instructions**: Check `AGENTS.md` for shared project build, test, and dependency commands
6. **Orient to the codebase first**: Read `docs/architecture.md` before making structural CLI changes

## Drive Mode Workflow

1. Run `/aigon:feature-start <ID>` to create branch and move spec
2. Run `/aigon:feature-do <ID>` to begin implementation
3. Read the spec path returned by `aigon feature-spec <ID>`
4. Implement the feature according to the spec
5. Test your changes and wait for user confirmation
6. Commit using conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
7. Update the implementation log in `./docs/specs/features/logs/`
8. **STOP** - Wait for user to approve before running `/aigon:feature-close <ID>`

## Research Workflow

Research follows the same lifecycle shape as features: `start -> do -> submit -> review/eval -> close`.

### Drive Mode

1. Run `/aigon:research-start <ID>` to move the topic to in-progress
2. Run `/aigon:research-do <ID>` to conduct the research
3. Write findings directly in the main research document
4. Optionally run `/aigon:research-review <ID>` for a second-agent review pass
5. Run `aigon agent-status submitted` when your research pass is complete (from outside the tmux session, use the explicit form: `aigon agent-status submitted <ID> <agent>`)
6. Run `/aigon:research-close <ID>` when ready to finish

## Saving Permissions

When the user says "save that permission", "remember that", or asks you to persist a permission you were just granted:

1. Read `.claude/settings.json`
2. Add the tool pattern to the `permissions.allow` array
3. Write the updated file
4. Confirm what you saved

Use the narrowest pattern that covers the user's intent:
- Specific: `Bash(npm test)`, `Bash(git push:*)`
- Broad: `Bash(npm:*)`, `Bash(node:*)`

Prefer specific patterns — broad Bash allows can be chained to bypass deny rules. Ask the user if unsure whether to save narrowly or broadly.

## Before Completing a Feature

Before running `/aigon:feature-close`, always:

1. **If you want GitHub PR review, publish the branch**:
   ```bash
   /aigon:feature-push
   ```
2. **Ask the user** if they want to delete the local branch after merge (the CLI will delete it by default)
